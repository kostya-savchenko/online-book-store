# ðŸ“š Online Book Store API

A secure and extensible backend system for managing books, categories, users, and orders. This API handles registration, JWT authentication, partial book updates via PATCH, role-based access control, and integration testing. It supports soft deletion using Hibernate annotations and uses Swagger for dynamic documentation. The project is containerized with Docker, version-controlled via Liquibase, and designed to scale in production-ready environments.
